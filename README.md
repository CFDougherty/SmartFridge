## Introduction

Managing fridge ingredients manually is tedious and often leads to food waste, 
expired items, and inefficient meal planning. Current solutions are too expensive or 
lack automation, making tracking and meal preparation frustrating for consumers.

Our AI Smart Fridge project project automates ingredient monitoring, expiration 
tracking, and recipe suggestions. By combining IoT and machine learning, it reduces 
food waste, generates shopping lists, alerts users to low stock, and simplifies meal 
planningâ€”all in one seamless system.


## Features
- **Inventory Tracking:** Monitors the quantity of items in the fridge using a camera and image recognition.
- **Expiration Monitoring:** Alerts users about soon-to-expire items to minimize waste.
- **Meal Suggestions:** Proposes meals based on available ingredients, dietary restrictions, and expiration rankings.
- **Shopping List:** Automatically builds a shopping list for low-stock items.
- **Integration with Delivery Services:** Enables users to order groceries directly from services like Instacart.
